Python by [0xC0DE](https://twitter.com/0xC0DE6502), an 8-bit game written in the e- programming language for Acorn Electron, BBC Micro and BBC Master. Can also be played on a PC (Windows or Linux+Wine) with the self-contained EXE.

## Aim of the game
Collect all diamonds to finish a level. If you stand still for too long, time will run out faster. You lose a life if you get stuck or when the time runs out. 

## How to play
There are 3 main ways to play the game:
1. Use the [tape image](https://github.com/0xC0DE6502/python-releases/raw/main/python.uef) on real hardware or an emulator
2. Use the [disk image](https://github.com/0xC0DE6502/python-releases/raw/main/python.ssd) on real hardware or an emulator
3. Play the [self-contained EXE](https://github.com/0xC0DE6502/python-releases/raw/main/python.exe) on a PC

### Linux+Wine
The self-contained Windows EXE works on Linux as well if you use Wine: `wine python.exe` or `wine python-alternate-keys.exe`. You need a 64-bit `WINEPREFIX` and enough video memory configured (`winetricks videomemorysize=1024`). I have played the game successfully on Ubuntu 22.04 using Wine 7.18. Known issue: toggling full-screen play (`ALT+ENTER`) may cause the game to lose keyboard focus. Fix: use `ALT+TAB` to select the game window again.

## Controls

Z - Left
X - Right
: - Up
/ - Down
```

### Alternate controls

```
. - Left
/ - Right
A - Up
Z - Down
```
